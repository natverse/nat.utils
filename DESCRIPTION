Description: Utility functions that may be of general interest
    but are specifically required by the 'NeuroAnatomy Toolbox' ('nat').
    Includes functions to provide a basic make style system to update
    files based on timestamp information, file locking and 'touch'
    utility. Convenience functions for working with file paths include
    'abs2rel', 'split_path' and 'common_path'. Finally there are utility
    functions for working with 'zip' and 'gzip' files including integrity
    tests.
