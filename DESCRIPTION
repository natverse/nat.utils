Title: File System Utility Functions for 'NeuroAnatomy Toolbox'
Description: Utility functions that may be of general interest but are 
    specifically required by the 'NeuroAnatomy Toolbox' ('nat'). Includes
    functions to provide a basic make style system to update files based on
    timestamp information, file locking and 'touch' utility. Convenience 
    functions for working with file paths include 'abs2rel', 'split_path' 
    and 'common_path'. Finally there are utility functions for working with 
    'zip' and 'gzip' files including integrity tests.
